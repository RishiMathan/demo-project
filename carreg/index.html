    <h3>Nature crisis</h3>

  <p>Renewable energy in Bulgaria: have the lessons of the past been learnt?</p>

  <p>Bulgaria’s recovery plan includes investments in renewable energy sources. Although the deployment of renewable energy should be supported, it is crucial to develop renewable projects in a way that does not negatively affect valuable natural habitats.</p><br><br>

  <h3>Hill stations</h3>

  <p>For example, the renewables measure in the recovery plan does not list which specific sources will be supported, but mentions photovoltaics, wind turbines and the use of water and marine resources. The project gives limited information about how investments in these renewable energy sources will limit the destruction to biodiversity, Natura 2000 sites and protected areas.</p><br><br>

  <h3>ISRO</h3>

  <p>
    The Indian Space Research Organisation[a] (ISRO; /ˈɪsroʊ/) is the national space agency of India, headquartered in Bangalore. ISRO is India's primary agency for performing tasks related to space-based applications, space exploration, and the development of related technologies.[6] The agency was established in 1963 and its programs and spinoff technologies have played a significant role in the socio-economic and industrial development of India and have supported both civilian and military domains in various aspects including disaster management, telemedicine, and navigation and reconnaissance missions. It operates under the Department of Space (DOS) which is directly overseen by the Prime Minister of India, while the Chairman of ISRO acts as the executive of DOS as well.

ISRO is one of six government space agencies in the world which possess full launch capabilities, deploy cryogenic engines, launch extraterrestrial missions, and operate large fleets of artificial satellites.[7][8][b] It has the world's largest constellation of remote-sensing satellites and operates the GAGAN and NAVIC satellite navigation systems. It has sent two missions to the Moon and one to Mars. The agency's goals for the near future include expanding its satellite fleet, landing a rover on Moon, sending humans into space, development of a semi-cryogenic engine, sending more uncrewed missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus and the Sun, and deployment of more space telescopes in orbit to observe cosmic phenomena and space beyond the Solar System. Long-term plans include development of reusable launchers, heavy and super heavy launch vehicles, deploying a space station, sending exploration missions to the outer planets and asteroids and crewed missions to moons and planets.

  <h3> Nations</h3>

  <p>
    Modern space research in India can be traced to the 1920s, when scientist S. K. Mitra conducted a series of experiments sounding of the ionosphere through ground-based radio in Kolkata.[10] Later, Indian scientists like C.V. Raman and Meghnad Saha contributed to scientific principles applicable in space sciences.[10] After 1945, important developments were made in coordinated space research in India[10] by two scientists: Vikram Sarabhai—founder of the Physical Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad—and Homi Bhabha, who established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1945.[10] Initial experiments in space sciences included the study of cosmic radiation, high altitude and airborne testing, deep underground experimentation at the Kolar mines—one of the deepest mining sites in the world—and studies of the upper atmosphere.[11] These studies were done at research laboratories, universities, and independent locations.[11][12]

In 1950, the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was founded with Bhabha as its secretary.[12] It provided funding for space research throughout India.[13] During this time, tests continued on aspects of meteorology and the Earth's magnetic field, a topic that had been studied in India since the establishment of the Colaba Observatory in 1823. In 1954, the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) was established in the foothills of the Himalayas.[12] The Rangpur Observatory was set up in 1957 at Osmania University, Hyderabad. Space research was further encouraged by the government of India.[13] In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 and opened up possibilities for the rest of the world to conduct a space launch.[13]
